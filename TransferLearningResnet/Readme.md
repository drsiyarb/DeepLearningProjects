# Purpose of this project is to demonstrate how to build and train a Deep Neural Network using Transfer Learning
1. Dataset used is Cifar-10 which contains images from 10 different classes (https://www.cs.toronto.edu/~kriz/cifar.html)
2. Architecture used is ResNet-50 (https://keras.io/api/applications/)
